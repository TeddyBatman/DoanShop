# DoanShop
Assignment 1

This assignment is a shop in which I have 3 different items in which you can add and remove to the total quantity of each item.
Furthermore you can checkout and have both tps and tvq taxes into the subtotal you have and it will create the new total with tax included.

I have taken inspiration from a codelab where there was a counter that goes up ( Hello Toast).
I have also used stackoverflow for help when I needed to send intents to another activity as int/double to strings and found out that using
a bundle is a lot more efficient rather than sending each intent extra one by one.
